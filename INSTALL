django-etc installation
=======================


Python ``setuptools`` package is required to install django-etc.


Use the following command line to install django-etc from sources directory (containing setup.py):

    easy_install .

or

    python setup.py install


Alternatively you can install an up-to-date version of django-etc from PyPI:
